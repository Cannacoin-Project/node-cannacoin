# A Node.js cannacoin Client!

![cannacoin](https://github.com/Cannacoin-Project/node-cannacoin-master/blob/master/node-cannacoin.png?raw=true)

node-cannacoin is a cannacoin client for Node.js. It is a fork of the excellent Kapitalize Bitcoin Client (now removed from GitHub) intended for use with cannacoin. The purpose of this repository is:

* Provide a one-stop resource for the Node.js developer to get started with cannacoin integration.
* Prevent would-be cannacoin web developers worrying whether a Bitcoin client will work out of the box.
* Promote Node.js development of cannacoin web apps.
* Identify and address any incompatibilities with the cannacoin and Bitcoin APIs that exist now and/or in the future.

## Dependencies

You'll need a running instance of [cannacoind](https://github.com/cannacoin-project/cannacoin) to connect with. If you're running Debian/Ubuntu, this worked for me: http://www.dogeco.in/wiki/index.php/cannacoind

Then, install the node-cannacoin NPM package.

`npm install node-cannacoin`

## Examples

Some code examples follow below, but for more complete examples, see [these snippets](https://github.com/cannacoin-project/cannacoin-code-snippets), or this [wallet app](comingsoon...) which was created to to test this module.

```js
var cannacoin = require('node-cannacoin')()

cannacoin.auth('myusername', 'mypassword')

cannacoin.getDifficulty(function() {
    console.log(arguments);
})

```

## Chaining

Pretty much everything is chainable.

```js
var cannacoin = require('node-cannacoin')()

cannacoin
.auth('MyUserName', 'mypassword')
.getNewAddress()
.getBalance()
```

## Methods

The [Litecoin API](https://litecoin.info/Litecoin_API) is supported as direct methods. Use either camelcase or lowercase.

```js
cannacoin.getNewAddress(function(err, address) {
    this.validateaddress(address, function(err, info) {

    })
})
```
### .exec(command [string], ...arguments..., callback [function])

Executes the given command with optional arguments. Function `callback` defaults to `console.log`.
All of the API commands are supported in lowercase or camelcase. Or uppercase. Anycase!

```js
cannacoin.exec('getNewAddress')

cannacoin.exec('getbalance', function(err, balance) {

})
```

### .set(key [string, object], value [optional])

Accepts either key & value strings or an Object containing settings, returns `this` for chainability.

```js
cannacoin.set('host', '127.0.0.1')
```

### .get(key [string])

Returns the specified option's value

```js
cannacoin.get('user')
```

### .auth(user [string], pass [string])

Generates authorization header, returns `this` for chainability

## Commands

TODO: Write tests for these.

All [Litecoin API](https://litecoin.info/Litecoin_API) commands are supported, in lowercase or camelcase form.

## Options

You may pass options to the initialization function or to the `set` method.

```js

var cannacoin = require('cannacoin')({
    user:'user'
})

cannacoin.set('pass', 'somn')
cannacoin.set({port:22555})

```

Available options and default values:

+ host *localhost*
+ port *22555*
+ user
+ pass
+ passphrasecallback
+ https
+ ca

### Passphrase Callback

With an encryped wallet, any operation that accesses private keys requires a wallet unlock. A wallet is unlocked using the `walletpassphrase <passphrase> <timeout>` JSON-RPC method: the wallet will relock after `timeout` seconds.

You may pass an optional function `passphrasecallback` to the `node-cannacoin` initialization function to manage wallet unlocks. `passphrasecallback` should be a function accepting three arguments:

    function(command, args, callback) {}

+ **command** is the command that failed due to a locked wallet.
+ **args** is the arguments for the failed command.
+ **callback** is a typical node-style continuation callback of the form `function(err, passphrase, timeout) {}`. Call callback with the wallet passphrase and desired timeout from within your passphrasecallback to unlock the wallet.

You may hard code your passphrase (not recommended) as follows:

```js
var cannacoin = require('node-cannacoin')({
    passphrasecallback: function(command, args, callback) {
        callback(null, 'passphrase', 30);
    }
})
```

Because `passphrasecallback` is a continuation, you can retrieve the passphrase in an asynchronous manner. For example, by prompting the user:

```js
var readline = require('readline')

var rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
})

var cannacoin = require('node-cannacoin')({
  passphrasecallback: function(command, args, callback) {
    rl.question('Enter passphrase for "' + command + '" operation: ', function(passphrase) {
      if (passphrase) {
        callback(null, passphrase, 1)
      } else {
        callback(new Error('no passphrase entered'))
      }
    })
  }
})
```

### Secure RPC with SSL

By default `cannacoind` exposes its JSON-RPC interface via HTTP; that is, all RPC commands are transmitted in plain text across the network! To secure the JSON-RPC channel you can supply `cannacoind` with a self-signed SSL certificate and an associated private key to enable HTTPS. For example, in your `cannacoin.conf`:

    rpcssl=1
    rpcsslcertificatechainfile=/etc/ssl/certs/cannacoind.crt
    rpcsslprivatekeyfile=/etc/ssl/private/cannacoind.pem

In order to securely access an SSL encrypted JSON-RPC interface you need a copy of the self-signed certificate from the server: in this case `cannacoind.crt`. Pass your self-signed certificate in the `ca` option and set `https: true` and node-cannacoin is secured!
    
```js
var fs = require('fs')

var ca = fs.readFileSync('cannacoind.crt')

var cannacoin = require('node-cannacoin')({
  user: 'rpcusername',
  pass: 'rpcpassword',
  https: true,
  ca: ca
})
```
